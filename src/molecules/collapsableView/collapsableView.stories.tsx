                  Roll Staking is an easy way for anyone to stake the tokens they hold or create staking
                  opportunities for others. Creators who have their own social tokens can use Roll
                  Staking to create liquidity mining campaigns, and people who hold social tokens can
                  decide to stake their tokens and receive rewards for doing so.

                  Roll Staking is a web3 feature that supports any and all ERC20 tokens, regardless of
                  whether they were minted on Roll or not.

                  As a creator, you can use our staking product to create a campaign and incentivize
                  your community to provide liquidity for your token in any token pair you’d like. You
                  do by rewarding them with tokens proportional to the size and the duration of the
                  liquidity they provide.

                  As a token holder, when you stake your tokens, you’re essentially locking them in a
                  smart contract in exchange for a percentage return based on how many tokens you’ve
                  staked and for how long.
